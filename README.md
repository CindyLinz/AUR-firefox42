# AUR firefox42

This is a archlinux package file, for firefox42.

I'll install Firefox version 42.0 and named `firefox42`.
So that you can still install and use other firefox versions without conflictions.

# Usage

git clone https://github.com/CindyLinz/AUR-firefox42.git
cd AUR-firefox42
makepkg -sri
```
